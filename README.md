## Not Just Another Docs Tool

Others give you keyword search. We give you that, plus semantic understanding, plus AI-powered hybrid search that combines both intelligently. Every search mode you need, working together.

**Minimal footprint. Maximum signal.** Our MCP tools are designed to be lean—no bloated responses, no wasted tokens, no noise cluttering your agent's context. Just the information that matters.
